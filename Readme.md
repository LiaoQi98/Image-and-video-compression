## Fractional-sample-accurate MCP and intra Coding for inter- and intra-prediction
Here we want to use fractional-pixel (e.g half-pixel) instead of full pixel for higher accuracy. We use linear interpolation and assign the mean of the four surrounding points to the interpolation point. In intra coding we encode the residual difference between predicted and actual block samples from different direction.
